                    his family when he gets home from work. He likes to be aware of what the weather 
                    will be like so he doesn't plan a swimming activity when it's going to rain. Ya know...

                    Persona 2: Natalie is 17 and in her senior year of High School. She is involved in a 
                    lot of extra-curricular activities, most of which take place outside. In addition to those,
                    she loves hanging out with her friends and teammates when they don't have to be somewhere 
                    for school purposes. She loves knowing what's going on so she and her friends can plan 
                    exciting adventures.

            <p>
                Scenario 1: Matt is finishing up work and wants to take his kids to the park to play soccer.
                He looks up the weatherandmore.co website to see what it says the weather will be like in his
                city. He finds out that it is supposed to be a little breezy and cloudy with a slight change 
                of rain. He doesn't want to pressure his kids into going to the park when they'll probably be 
                cold, so he decides to bring up the option of a movie night with his wife when he gets home. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Scenario 2: Natalie is in her seventh period class and is already thinking about plans with 
                her friends after school since she doesn't have practice today. She thinks about going with 
                friends to the farmer's market, but wants to check the weather first. She pulls up the website 
                and finds out that it's going to be sunny and pretty warm. On her way to her last class, she tracks
                down her friends and asks their opinion. They think it's a great idea, escpecially since there
                is a splash pad just across the street that they can go to if it gets too hot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scenario 3: Matt is hanging out with some of his college friends that are in town and he brings 
                up the option of going to the drive-in theater that night. His friends seem a bit skeptical, so 
                he pulls up the website on his phone to check what the weather will be like. He tells them that
                it will be clear skies and sixty-five degrees, perfect weather to watch the movie, star gaze a 
                bit, and all they'll need is a light jacket to be comfortable. His friends are persuaded and
                they start making preparations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scenario 4: Natalie is packing her soccer bag so she will be ready for their game the following
                day. She goes to her clost and notices her lightweight althetic jacket hanging up. She decides
                to check the weather to see if she'll need that or not. She pulls up the website on her phone
                and notices that it is supposed to be cloudy and slightly breezy. She packs the jacket because 
                it's better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Scenario 5: Matt and his wife are talking about plans for the following week since it is summer
                and the kids don't have school. They talk about going rock climbing and swimming at the outdoor 
                rec area, but decide to double check that the weather will be good. They assume it will because
                it's summer, but in their area, they have had some surprising weather changes in the past. They
                pull up the website and see that it is supposed to be in the high 70's. They smile at each other
                and make the plans with the kids.
