            <p>There is good white space on this website because each book has its own space and there 
                is room for the eye to rest and appreciate what is on this webpage.

            <img src="Temples-rule-of-thirds.png" alt="Church of Jesus Christ Temples website example">
            <p>This website shows the rule of thirds well becuase major parts of the Temples are either
                on the lines for the rule of thirds, or they are on the crosshairs of those lines.

            <p>There is good visual hierarchy with this website because the things that are the most important
                or time sensitive are the most prominent with the biggest type and images. The articles that 
                are not as new or interesting are smaller and lower down the page to show they are not as important
                at the time.
