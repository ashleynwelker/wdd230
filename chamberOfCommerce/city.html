            <section>
                <h2>Brief History</h2>
                <p>Eagle Mountain is a young town that has grown at a breakneck pace. While the area 
                    was along the pony express trail in the 1860s, the town only had a population 
                    of 250 when it was incorporated in 1996. Since then it has grown rapidly and 
                    become the largest city by land space in Utah County, and the population has 
                    jumped from 250 to over 35,000 in a little over 20 years. It has also produced 
                    two Olympians. The rapid city growth has been stressful on city leadership, with 
                    the town having thirteen different mayors in twenty-one years, with only one making 
                    it to the end of her term. With its rapid growth, Eagle Mountain is also a young town, 
                    with almost half the population under age eighteen.</p>
